    <p>In this project, Lou Salazar Castillo formats selected text titled "The Garden of Forking Paths'' by Jorge Luis Borges. The assignment was to build a multi-page website and in doing so experiment with its navigation to convey a meaning, as well as to utilize expressive typography. Lou did so by highlighting certain areas of the text with a cursor that when hovered over certain areas of the text, reveals larger text or text that had previously been hidden.
